Intelligent module for TRELLO
=============================

Software solution in the form of an intelligent module for expanding the functionality of a browser-based management system for IT-projects - Trello, based on the use of its API. To select data from the boards, lists, cards, functions were developed using procedural programming methods. During the development of the intellectual module, a UML-class diagram of the intellectual module developed according to the existing py-trello library. For aggregation of data, selected from the boards, lists, cards, the modern Pandas library is used. The Pandas features such as reading, writing to a Microsoft Excel file, data grouping, reloading the table index, arithmetic adding and multiplication were used. Approval of the results confirmed the feasibility of the development of the implementation of monthly reporting and calculation of employee productivity metrics.
